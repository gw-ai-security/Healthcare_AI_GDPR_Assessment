# Detection Rule Template

_Use this template to design, document, and review security detection rules that monitor for GDPR-relevant events._

---

## Purpose
To define clear, auditable detection rules for SIEM or log analysis that help identify potential GDPR compliance violations.

---

## Detection Rule Summary

- **Rule Name:**

## False Positive / Negative Analysis

| Risk Scenario                    | Likelihood | Impact | Notes / Mitigation             |
|-----------------------------------|------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Legitimate test environments      | Medium     | Low    | Tag and exclude test logs     |
| Delayed consent sync              | Medium     | Medium | Add time-based grace periods  |
| IP geolocation inaccuracies       | High       | Medium | Regularly update IP mapping   |

*Instructions:*  
- Think critically about how the rule could misfire.
- Include mitigation plans.

---

## Response / Alerting Plan

- **Severity Level:** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Alert Destination:** (SIEM dashboard, email, ticketing system)
- **Escalation Path:** (e.g. Security team, DPO)
- **Recommended Actions:**  
  - Review logs
  - Validate consent records
  - Notify responsible owners

*Instructions:*  
- Make sure teams know what to do when the rule triggers.

---

## Testing & Validation

- **Test Date:**  
- **Tester:**  
- **Test Scenario:**  
  - How was the rule validated?
- **Result:**  
  - Passed / Issues found

*Instructions:*  
- Ensure rules are tested before production deployment.
