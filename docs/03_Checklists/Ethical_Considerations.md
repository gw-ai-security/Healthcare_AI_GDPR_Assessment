# Ethical Considerations for Healthcare AI GDPR Assessment

This document outlines ethical AI considerations and recommendations relevant to GDPR compliance assessments of Healthcare AI systems.

---

## Purpose
To ensure that the AI system is designed and operated not only to comply with GDPR but also to meet ethical and societal expectations, especially in sensitive healthcare contexts.

---

## Key Ethical AI Principles

### 1️Transparency
- Explainability of AI decisions.
- Ability to document and justify model outputs.
- Avoidance of black-box systems in critical healthcare use cases.

*Questions to Ask:*
- Can clinicians understand the AI's decision process?
- Are explanations provided in user-friendly language?

---

### 2️Fairness and Non-Discrimination
- Avoid bias against protected groups.
- Regularly audit training data and outputs for discrimination.
- Implement bias mitigation strategies.

*Questions to Ask:*
- Has the training data been checked for bias?
- Are there disparate outcomes across demographics?

---

###  Privacy by Design (GDPR Article 25)
- Minimize collection and use of personal data.
- Pseudonymize or anonymize where possible.
- Enforce purpose limitation and storage limitation.

*Questions to Ask:*
- Are only necessary fields collected?
- Is sensitive data pseudonymized in logs?

---

###  Human Oversight (GDPR Article 22, EU AI Act)
- Ensure human review of AI decisions with significant impact.
- Avoid fully automated decisions without recourse.

 *Questions to Ask:*
- Is there a human-in-the-loop validation process?
- Can decisions be challenged or overturned?

---

###  Accountability
- Clear documentation of design choices and risk assessments.
- Defined responsibilities for AI monitoring and incident response.

 *Questions to Ask:*
- Who is responsible for ethical compliance?
- Is there an incident response playbook in place?

---

##  Recommendations
- Include Explainability Modules in the AI system.
- Document Bias Audits and mitigation steps.
- Ensure DSFA includes ethical risks.
- Provide user training on AI limitations and appropriate use.
- Implement clear Human Oversight workflows.

---

##  Outcome
A system that:
- Meets GDPR requirements (e.g. Art. 5, 9, 22, 25).
- Demonstrates ethical design and deployment.
- Enhances trust among patients, clinicians, and regulators.
