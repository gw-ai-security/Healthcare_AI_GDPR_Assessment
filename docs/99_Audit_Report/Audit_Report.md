# Audit Report – Healthcare AI GDPR & Compliance Assessment

## Executive Summary

This audit assesses the GDPR and EU AI Act compliance posture of a simulated Healthcare AI system used across radiology, wearables, and telemedicine contexts. It evaluates data privacy risks, high-risk AI classification, and security measures, with a focus on real-world detection use cases.

The assessed system qualifies as a **high-risk AI system** under the EU AI Act and processes **special category data** under GDPR (Art. 9). The primary objective is to verify whether appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs) are implemented and whether detection mechanisms reliably identify key violations.

## Key Technical & Organizational Measures (TOMs)

- AES-256 encryption for data at rest  
- TLS 1.3 for secure data in transit  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with separation of duties  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin logins  
- Consent audit logs with tamper-evident timestamps  
- Data pseudonymization using SHA-256  
- Drift detection pipeline for model behavior  
- Privacy by Design embedded in AI architecture  

---

## Recommendations

1. **Enforce GeoIP-based export filtering** for all outbound traffic when consent is not verifiably set to `true`.
2. **Implement anomaly detection** and AI monitoring frameworks (e.g. Evidently, Alibi Detect).
3. **Harden consent workflows** with visible status indicators and audit-trail immutability.
4. **Configure SIEM alerts** for admin access outside operational hours.
5. **Perform quarterly DSFA updates**, with automated alignment to detection rules and alerts.

##  Audit Conclusion & Compliance Outlook

| Framework   | Status        | Observations                                 |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| GDPR        | ~90% aligned  | Strong TOMs; traceability on Art. 7 improvable |
| EU AI Act   | Partial       | High-Risk classification handled; monitoring gaps remain |
| ISO 27001   | Partial       | Access control mature; risk mgmt plan missing |
| NIST CSF    | Informative   | Detect/Respond domains underdeveloped        |

**Final Assessment:**  
> The system is **audit-ready for GDPR Art. 32 and 44**, with effective controls for data protection and export restrictions. Improvements are recommended in **post-market monitoring (AI Act)** and **consent traceability (Art. 7 GDPR)** to achieve full maturity across compliance frameworks.
