# üßæ Audit Report ‚Äì Healthcare AI GDPR & Compliance Assessment

## üß† Executive Summary

This audit assesses the GDPR and AI Act compliance posture of a simulated Healthcare AI system used in radiology, wearables, and telemedicine. It focuses on data privacy, ethical AI usage, and regulatory risk related to the use of machine learning in patient data environments.

The system is classified as a **high-risk AI system** under the EU AI Act and processes **sensitive personal data** (GDPR Art. 9). The goal is to ensure that technical and organizational measures (TOMs) are in place and detection mechanisms can identify key violations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Technical & Organizational Measures (TOMs)

- ‚úÖ AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- ‚úÖ TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- ‚úÖ Role-based access controls (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin access
- ‚úÖ Consent audit logs with timestamp & user ID
- ‚úÖ Pseudonymization using SHA-256
- ‚úÖ Privacy by Design practices embedded in data pipeline

---

## üéØ Recommendations

1. **Enable GeoIP-based export blocking** for non-EU destinations unless `ConsentStatus=true`.
2. **Implement anomaly detection** on model outputs using statistical drift analysis (Evidently, SHAP).
3. **Enforce masking** on diagnostic codes unless user role = clinical.
4. **Tag & monitor admin logins** occurring outside defined business hours.
5. **Conduct DSFA updates quarterly**, and ensure traceability from logs to GDPR articles.
