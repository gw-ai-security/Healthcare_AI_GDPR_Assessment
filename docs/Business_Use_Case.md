# Business Use Case

This document describes the real-world scenario for the **Healthcare AI GDPR Compliance Assessment** project.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Background
A hospital is using an AI-powered system for radiology diagnostics. This system processes sensitive health data, including diagnostic codes and patient metadata. According to **GDPR Article 9**, health data is classified as a *special category of personal data*, requiring extra protection and explicit consent.

---

## ðŸ›‘ Problem
- Storage of highly sensitive diagnostic data without clear consent management.
- Potential data transfers to non-EU countries without adequacy agreements or safeguards.
- Lack of Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation checks.
- Missing retention policies or automated deletion strategies.
- Insufficient encryption or pseudonymization.
- Inadequate audit logs or monitoring for unauthorized access.

---

## âœ… Project Goal
- Simulate a realistic GDPR compliance audit for healthcare AI system logs.
- Identify concrete GDPR violations and compliance risks.
- Apply **Privacy by Design** (GDPR Article 25) principles.
- Deliver a **reusable consulting framework** including:
  - Data analysis notebooks
  - GDPR checklists
  - Detection rules
  - DSFA templates
  - Executive-ready Audit Report

---

## ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcomes
- Clean, auditable documentation for internal or client use.
- Practical detection rules for SIEM or logging systems.
- Concrete recommendations to reduce GDPR-related risks and penalties.
- Support for Data Protection Officers (DPOs), CISOs, AI Product Managers and Security Architects.
