# ðŸ“Œ Technical and Organizational Measures

This section documents the **key measures** that support GDPR, HIPAA, and EU AI Act compliance in Healthcare AI environments.

---

## âœ… Access Controls

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Regular access reviews

**SIEM Implications:**
- Alert on privilege escalations
- Monitor MFA bypass attempts

---

## âœ… Encryption and Secure Storage

- Data-at-rest encryption
- TLS for data-in-transit
- Managed key rotation

**SIEM Implications:**
- Detect unencrypted transfers
- Monitor encryption failures

---

## âœ… Cloud Security Best Practices

- Secure Cloud Storage configurations (e.g., AWS S3 Bucket Policies)
- IAM Role separation
- Audit logging for Cloud API calls

**SIEM Implications:**
- Alert on public bucket exposures
- Monitor cloud misconfigurations

---

## âœ… Data Minimization and Pseudonymization

- Store only required fields
- Apply anonymization/pseudonymization where possible
- Document data retention limits

**SIEM Implications:**
- Detect excessive data fields
- Alert on access to raw identifiers

---

## âœ… Incident Response Planning

- Defined escalation paths
- Forensic readiness
- Integration with SIEM alerting
- Regular incident simulations

**SIEM Implications:**
- Ensure detection rules map to playbooks
- Capture context-rich logs for investigations

---

## âœ… Organizational Policies

- Regular staff training on data protection
- Vendor management and assessments
- Privacy Impact Assessments (DSFA)
- Continuous policy updates

**SIEM Implications:**
- Demonstrate governance
- Evidence for audits

---

## âœ… Encryption Standards and Recommendations

To ensure GDPR Article 32 compliance, encryption must be applied **at rest** and **in transit** using industry-standard algorithms.

**Recommended Standards:**
- **AES-256:** For encrypting data at rest (databases, file storage)
- **TLS 1.3:** For data in transit (APIs, web services)

**Key Management Best Practices:**
- Use cloud KMS (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
- Enforce strict access controls on key material

**SIEM Implications:**
- Alert on unencrypted transfers
- Log encryption failures or key access attempts
- Monitor configurations for weak cipher suites
