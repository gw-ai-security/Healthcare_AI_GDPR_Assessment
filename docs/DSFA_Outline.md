# DSFA Outline

This document serves as a template for conducting a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA/DSFA)** for the Healthcare AI GDPR Compliance Assessment project.

---

## üéØ Purpose
To identify, analyze, and mitigate privacy risks associated with processing sensitive health data via an AI system.

---

## üìå DPIA Sections

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Description of Processing
- Purpose of the AI system
- Categories of data processed (e.g. diagnosis codes, timestamps)
- Data flows and storage locations
- Transfers to non-EU countries

‚úÖ *Example:*  
"AI system for radiology analysis processes patient diagnosis codes, user IDs, timestamps, and country data. Logs may be transferred to cloud storage, including non-EU locations."

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Necessity and Proportionality
- Is data processing justified for its purpose?
- Are there less intrusive alternatives?
- Has Data Minimization been applied?

‚úÖ *Checklist:*  
- [ ] Clear purpose documented  
- [ ] Data fields reviewed for necessity  
- [ ] Minimization strategies implemented

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Measures to Mitigate Risks
- Data encryption and pseudonymization
- Strong access controls
- Consent management workflows
- Regular audits and logging
- Employee training

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Consultation with DPO
- Review DSFA with the Data Protection Officer
- Ensure legal approval before deployment

---

## ‚úÖ Notes on Use
- Fill in all sections for your specific use case.
- Review and update regularly.
- Attach supporting documents as needed (Dataflow Diagram, Detection Rules, Policies).

---

## üìå Outcome
A complete, auditable DSFA document demonstrating GDPR Article 35 compliance and supporting Privacy by Design (Article 25) obligations.
