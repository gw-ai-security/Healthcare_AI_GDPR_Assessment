## Notes

- **High Risk**: RULE_004 (Art. 44) has the highest fine potential under GDPR.
- **Cross-Mapping**: Several dashboard views (e.g., CISO & DPO) overlap in rule visibility but differ in access granularity.
- **Audit Use**: This table supports quick traceability and Art. 30 audit documentation.
