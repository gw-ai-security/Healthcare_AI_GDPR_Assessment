> **A consulting-ready, audit-grade dashboard framework for GDPR and EU AI Act compliance in healthcare AI systems**

## Project Overview

This project delivers a **complete, realistic, portfolio-ready framework** simulating a full consulting engagement for healthcare AI systems. It provides role-based dashboards for compliance monitoring, audit trail management, and real-time GDPR violation detection.

### Why This Matters

Healthcare AI systems process **special category data** (GDPR Art. 9) and are classified as **High-Risk AI Systems** under the **EU AI Act (2024)**. Non-compliance penalties can reach **€20 million or 4% of global turnover**.
