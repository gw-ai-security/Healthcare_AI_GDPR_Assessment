# Healthcare AI GDPR Compliance Assessment

_A professional, consulting-ready framework for auditing and ensuring GDPR compliance in healthcare AI systems._

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This repository provides a **complete, reusable, audit-ready framework** for assessing GDPR compliance of AI systems in the healthcare sector.  

It simulates a real-world consulting engagement: analyzing data processing logs, mapping GDPR requirements, designing detection rules for SIEM, conducting risk assessments, and producing executive-level reports.

---

## 📌 Why This Matters

Healthcare AI systems process **special category data** under GDPR (Article 9), requiring:

- Strict purpose limitation
- Explicit, verifiable consent
- Secure processing with encryption/pseudonymization
- Demonstrable compliance with Privacy by Design (Article 25)

Non-compliance risks **fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual turnover**.

---

## ✅ Value Proposition

This framework is designed for:

- **Security Architects** who need audit-ready SIEM rules and threat models
- **Data Protection Officers (DPOs)** ensuring GDPR compliance
- **AI Product Managers** prioritizing privacy-by-design features
- **Consultants** delivering client-ready assessments

---

## 🚀 What You Get

✔️ Reusable templates and checklists  
✔️ Data analysis notebooks (Jupyter)  
✔️ GDPR field mappings and detection rules  
✔️ Risk assessment and DSFA outlines  
✔️ Ethical AI considerations (bias, explainability, oversight)  
✔️ A complete, consulting-ready **Audit Report**
