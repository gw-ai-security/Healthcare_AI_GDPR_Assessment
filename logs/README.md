## üîê Compliance Purpose

- Enables GDPR **Art. 30** traceability (record of processing activities)
- Supports internal and external **auditors** by tracking who accessed what, when, and under which role
- Can be integrated with downstream SIEM systems or reviewed manually

## üß† Logging Format

```
timestamp,user,role,view,action
2025-07-22T14:53:00Z,dpo_user,DPO,DPO Dashboard,Exported Consent Report
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practice

- Do **not commit** real logs to public repositories  
- Add `logs/*.csv` to `.gitignore` in production environments  
- Rotate logs periodically to limit size and exposure risk

---

## ‚úÖ How It's Used

The log entries are written via the function:

```python
from app.utils.audit_logger import log_action

log_action(user, role, action, view)
```

This function is embedded in all role-specific dashboard views.
